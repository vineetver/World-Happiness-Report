# World Happiness Report

The world happiness report dataset was developed from the Gallup World Poll in which the institution gathered information on a country’s ladder score as well as other potential explanatory factors of a country’s happiness. The report continues to be utilized “as governments, organizations, and civil society increasingly use happiness indicators to inform their policy-making decisions.”
